Abstract:
Good evg everyone this is srikar from batch 4 of resarchgroup ai and ml .let me introduce my teammates
our project title is ckd using effective classification and using recursive feature elemination technique we done this project under
the guidance of b sridhara murthy sir

In this project we are going to detect whether a person has CKD or not.
CKD is a condition on kidney which causes kidney to slow down its functions and eventually causing kidney falure
Some of the causes of ckd are hypertension and diabettes.we can detect ckd using gromerular filteration rate
where a normal perso have gfr in the range of 100  to 120 where as person with ckd will have below 60 .
so this gfr can be calculated using 
persons age,gender,race,these variables will become features in our model.
Early detection and treatment can often keep ckd getting worse
So in this project we are going to use some of the classification techniques such as SVM,KNN,Decision Tree and Random forest 
and pick the best model suitable and also we are going to use recursive feature elimination techniques to obtain most relevant features to build an efficient model
